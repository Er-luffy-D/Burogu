              Since the invention of the internet, we have been using different
              applications and web pages to get data for various resources.
              However, have you ever thought, where does this data come from?
              Well, itâ€™s the servers from where we get the data. So in this
              article on What is REST API, let us look into how a client
              communicates with the servers to extract the required
              information.Need of REST API . Consider a scenario where you are
              using the Book My Show app. Now, obviously, this application needs
              a lot of Input data, as the data present in the application is
              never static. Either it is movies getting released on a frequent
              basis, or various cities showing different languages movies at
              various times of the day. It's never static which implies to the
              fact that data is always changing in these applications.
